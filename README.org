* Hello, CLJS!
This is my attempt to start with ClojureScript.

At first, the language, tooling, and ecosystem can be
overwhelming. When looking for tutorials to get started with
ClojureScript, they mention tools or libraries that are completely
unknown for a newbie: leiningen? Figwheel? Shadow-CLJS? Reagent?
Re-frame? To me, it all seemed like too much, so I decided to learn
from scratch and learn each bit of the tooling incrementally, to
understand why I need them in the first place and how they all fit
together.

This repository starts with [[https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start][ClojureScript's quickstart]].
